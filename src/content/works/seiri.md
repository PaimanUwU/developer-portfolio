# 🧠 Seiri (整理)

### **"The Second Brain for the Distracted Mind."**

**Seiri** is a modular, high-performance knowledge engine built for people whose brains have too many tabs open. It’s a PARA-method organizer that lives in your terminal today and will haunt your desktop tomorrow.

If your "system" for taking notes is currently a graveyard of `untitled_final_v2.md` files scattered across your `Downloads` folder, **Seiri** is here to slap some order into your life.

## Key Philosophy

* **Keyboard-First:** Deep integration with Vim-style keybindings ($h, j, k, l$).
* **Modern Brutalist:** High-contrast, bold aesthetics using the **Catppuccin Mocha** palette.
* **Modular Architecture:** A "Headless" engine that separates file logic from the interface, allowing for TUI, Desktop, and Web versions to share the same brain.
* **Local-First:** Your notes are plain Markdown files on your disk. No proprietary databases, no cloud lock-in.

---

## 1. The Core Engine (Platform Agnostic)

* **Logic-First Design:** The `/core` package contains zero UI code. It handles file system operations, metadata parsing, and search, making it compatible with any future interface.
* **Concurrency:** Leverages Go Goroutines for background file indexing and Git synchronization, ensuring the UI never flickers or freezes.
* **Cross-Platform:** Native support for **macOS** (development) and **Linux** (deployment on CachyOS/Arch) via Go's powerful cross-compilation.

## 2. The Interfaces

* **TUI (Current):** A terminal interface built with `bubbletea` and `lipgloss`. It follows the Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern for a snappy, state-driven experience.
* **Desktop (Future):** Built with `Wails`, allowing the same Go backend to power a modern web-tech frontend (Astro/React) for a full GUI experience.

## The Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Modular Core)

* [x] Initialize Go environment and Git repository.
* [ ] **Core Logic:** Implement file scanning and PARA categorization logic.
* [ ] **Config System:** Build a robust YAML loader for cross-platform note paths.
* [ ] **TUI Skeleton:** Display basic file lists in a multi-column layout.

### Phase 2: Interaction (MVU Pattern)

* [ ] **Navigation:** Smooth Vim-style movement between Kanban columns.
* [ ] **Markdown Preview:** Integrate `glamour` for rich terminal rendering of notes.
* [ ] **Live Editing:** Support for toggling Markdown checkboxes directly from the TUI.

### Phase 3: Utility (Intelligence)

* [ ] **Global Search:** Blazing fast fuzzy search across the entire notes directory.
* [ ] **Triage Mode:** Quick-move workflow to process the `00_Inbox` into relevant PARA folders.
* [ ] **Git Sync:** Background auto-commits and remote syncing.

### Phase 4: Expansion (The Second Face)

* [ ] **Polish:** Finalize the "Modern Brutalist" aesthetic with thick borders and icons.
* [ ] **GUI Prototype:** Initialize `Wails` to bridge the Go core to a web-based frontend.
